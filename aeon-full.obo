The ontology is independent of knowledge, creative domain, or topics related to events. AEON is focused on events and assumes the representation of many entities associated with events such as attendees, locations, academic works, datetimes, and processes are defined in compatible ontologies." xsd:string

Hence they are defined here rather adhoc with the reference to a specific academic event type specification that specifies its sociocultural format. These specific plan specifications are provided in AEON as named individuals for the purpose of automatically classifying academic events within the application of the ConfIDent project.\nIt is the intention of the ConfIDent project to collect and analyse a large body of empirical data on academic events and series, especially with regard to the inherent academic event plan specifications, so that an evidence based diffirentiation might be possible.

Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

However, this does not mean that fiat object parts are dependent for their existence on divisions or delineations effected by cognitive subjects. If, for example, it is correct to conceive geological layers of the Earth as fiat object parts of the Earth, then even though these layers were first delineated in recent times, still existed long before such delineation and what holds of these layers (for example that the oldest layers are also the lowest layers) did not begin to hold because of our acts of delineation.Treatment of material entity in BFOExamples viewed by some as problematic cases for the trichotomy of fiat object part, object, and object aggregate include: a mussel on (and attached to) a rock, a slime mold, a pizza, a cloud, a galaxy, a railway train with engine and multiple carriages, a clonal stand of quaking aspen, a bacterial community (biofilm), a broken femur. Note that, as Aristotle already clearly recognized, such problematic cases – which lie at or near the penumbra of instances defined by the categories in question – need not invalidate these categories. The existence of grey objects does not prove that there are not objects which are black and objects which are white; the existence of mules does not prove that there are not objects which are donkeys and objects which are horses.

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops.

It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its\ncurrent place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to\n'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue\nfor now." xsd:string

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

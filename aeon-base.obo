Hence they are defined here rather adhoc with the reference to a specific academic event type specification that specifies its sociocultural format. These specific plan specifications are provided in AEON as named individuals for the purpose of automatically classifying academic events within the application of the ConfIDent project.\nIt is the intention of the ConfIDent project to collect and analyse a large body of empirical data on academic events and series, especially with regard to the inherent academic event plan specifications, so that an evidence based diffirentiation might be possible.
